# Experiment with Elixir and Riak Core

Trying to use riak_core in Elixir.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `mix deps.get`
3. Run `iex --name node1@127.0.0.1 -S mix run`

And it should work.

## Docker

It doesn't build with docker yet. If it did, just running `docker build .`
should build an image.
